# S-P-500-Stocks-Analysis

Owning stocks in different companies can help you build your savings, protect your money from inflation and taxes, and maximize income from your investments. It's important to know that there are risks when investing in the stock market. That's the part where our project comes in handy. We will take you on a mini-tour in the stock market. We expect you to have a clear understanding of the stock market and be aware of the right time and make use of the right opportunity to invest your money in, when the time is risky to invest, and when it's not even worth it.
Our focus will be on the 500 S&P Index.
The S&P 500 Index, or Standard & Poor's 500 Index, is a market-capitalization-weighted index of 500 leading publicly traded companies in the U.S. It is not a list of the top 500 U.S. companies by market cap because there are other criteria that the index includes. Still, the S&P 500 index is regarded as one of the best gauges of prominent American equities' performance, and by extension, that of the stock market overall.
After you gain enough knowledge about the 500 S&P Index, we will talk about the hero of our story, Uber.
Uber Technologies, Inc. (Uber) is an American mobility service provider based in San Francisco with operations in approximately 72 countries and 10,500 cities. Its services include:
<br>•Ride-hailing<br>
•Food delivery (Uber Eats and Postmates)<br>
•Package delivery<br>
•Couriers<br>
•Freight transportation<br>
•Electric bicycle<br>
•Motorized scooter rental via a partnership with Lime<br>
•Ferry transport (partnership with local operators).<br>
Uber does not own any vehicles; instead, it receives a commission from each booking. Fares are quoted to the customer in advance but vary using a dynamic pricing model based on the local supply and demand at the time of the booking.
Our team chose Uber as our story's main focus because not only does the company have its ups and downs, but it also got an exciting story to tell.
